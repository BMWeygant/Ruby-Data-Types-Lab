# Ruby Data Class Types Lab
<strong>This guide assumes you have Ruby installed on your machine, a text editor, and a Github account already in place.</strong>

Here, you will write methods containing each of the data types mentioned in the[Ruby Data Types](https://dev.to/bmweygant/ruby-data-type-classes-numbers-arrays-symbols-hashes-2kka) lesson.

1. Write a method called `ua_1a_class_size` that takes 2 arguments, `new_students` (number) and `class_size` (number) and adds them together to return the new class size.
2. Write a method called `todays_class_schedule` that takes an argument of an array and returns the array.
3. Write a method called `student_quirks` that returns a hash of the students with their quirks.
